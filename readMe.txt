VIDEO POKER GAME 

I started this project by writing the Card and Deck classes.I then wrote the Player class and finally "Game" because I knew it would be more detailed and would take a little longer to bring all the other classes together into this main one. 
I used substrings in My checkHand method to make it possible to print the letters in
reference to the suits and the ranks in the command-line argument, and I called on the compare method from Card class as well. Down on my play method I made extensive use of for loops to print, give and evaluate hands in the game. I also created a sort method to use a sort from collections, at the end of my game class to sort out my cards once displayed. 
So the way my game works is: it starts off with a balance of 100 tokens and it asks the user how many he/she/they would like to play, then it returns the bankroll balance and delivers a hand.
I created the for loop in a way that the game asks 5 times if the user would like to replace each card because it was easier to use a set method than a remove/add for the undesirable cards. Then a new hand is generated and the result is given as well as the current token balance - the player can decide if they would like to play again.
